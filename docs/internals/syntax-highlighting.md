# Windowed Syntax Highlighting Engine

This document details the architecture and performance strategies of px0's windowed syntax highlighting engine ([`highlight.go`](../../highlight.go)).

## 1. The Syntax Highlighting Bottleneck

px0 utilizes [Chroma](https://github.com/alecthomas/chroma) (a pure Go syntax highlighter modeled after Pygments) to tokenize ~280 programming languages without external dependencies or CGO.

However, full-AST lexical analysis is computationally intensive:

- Chroma lexers typically process source text at roughly 500 KB to 1.5 MB per second.
- Highlighting a 100,000-line file (several megabytes of code) upfront would introduce a 3-to-8 second freeze before displaying the first line.
- Naive lexing of an entire file requires holding millions of syntax token structs on the heap.

To deliver instantaneous file opening (under 5 milliseconds), px0 implements Viewport-Based Windowed Highlighting with Dual-Tier Background Refinement.

## 2. Windowed Highlighting Architecture

Rather than tokenizing the entire file, px0 tokenizes only the slice of lines needed by the user's current scroll viewport, padded with leading and trailing context:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph FullFile ["Complete Source File (e.g. 50,000 lines)"]
        LeadIgnored["Preceding Lines (Skipped)"]
        ContextBefore["Leading Context (400 lines)"]
        Viewport["Viewport Chunk (1,000 lines)"]
        ContextAfter["Trailing Context (400 lines)"]
        TailIgnored["Remaining Lines (Skipped)"]
    end

    ContextBefore --> Lexer["Chroma Lexer (Bound Window)"]
    Viewport --> Lexer
    ContextAfter --> Lexer
    Lexer --> WindowEmit["Slice Out Exact Viewport HTML<br/>Discard Context Markup"]
```

### Highlighting Parameters

- `hlChunk = 1000`: Number of active lines tokenized for the current request.
- `hlContext = 400`: Number of preceding lines fed into the lexer.
  - Leading Context Purpose: Resets the lexer into the correct multi-line state (e.g., inside a multi-line docstring, backtick template literal, or block comment).
  - Trailing Context Purpose: Ensures open tokens are properly closed without trailing syntax anomalies.
- `hlWindowBytes = 512 KB`: Maximum byte size for any tokenization window.

### Byte-Cap Protection (`hlWindowBytes`)

In minified JavaScript or massive one-line JSON documents, 1,000 lines could equal 20+ megabytes of text. If a window slice exceeds `512 KB`, context lines are automatically dropped to prevent CPU hangs.

## 3. Dual-Tier Refinement Architecture

While 400 lines of context correctly identifies >99.5% of syntax states, extreme cases exist where a raw string literal or comment block opens 2,000 lines earlier.

px0 handles this with a Dual-Tier Processing Strategy:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant UI as Browser Virtual DOM
    participant Server as /api/file Endpoint
    participant FastHl as Fast Window Highlighter
    participant BgHl as Background Full-File Lexer
    participant Cache as LRU Highlight Cache

    UI->>Server: GET /api/file?path=main.go&start=1000&count=500
    Server->>Cache: Check Cache
    alt Cache Miss
        Server->>FastHl: Lex lines 600-2400 (Window + Context)
        FastHl-->>Server: Return HTML + Flag (refine: true)
        Server-->>UI: Serve inexact lines immediately (<2ms)
        Note over UI: UI paints lines with 0ms scroll hitching
        Server->>BgHl: Spawn background exact pass (if file < 2 MB)
        BgHl->>Cache: Populate exact token lines in background
        UI->>Server: Poll /api/file (or chunk refinement swap)
        Server-->>UI: Deliver exact tokenized HTML (refine: false)
        Note over UI: Non-destructive DOM line swap (refineChunk)
    end
```

1. Tier 1 (Instant Viewport Pass): Evaluates the bounded window (`start - hlContext` to `start + count + hlContext`). Slices out and returns the target lines in 1-2 ms. If the window contains potential multi-line ambiguities, the payload includes `refine: true`.
1. Tier 2 (Background Exact Pass): If the file is under `bgLimit = 2 MB`, a background goroutine performs an exact full-file tokenization pass. The exact result is stored in the LRU cache. The frontend's `refineChunk()` updates the rendered rows in-place without disturbing the user's scroll position or selection.

## 4. Short-Class CSS Tokenization

Chroma's default HTML formatter outputs lengthy inline CSS or verbose class names (e.g. `<span class="chroma-keyword-declaration">func</span>`), which bloats the DOM and increases network payload size.

px0 maps token types to minimal 1-to-2 character CSS classes:

| Class  | Chroma Token Type    | Semantic Role                                 |
| ------ | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `.k`   | `Keyword`            | Language keywords (`func`, `return`, `class`) |
| `.nf`  | `NameFunction`       | Function declarations and calls               |
| `.s`   | `LiteralString`      | String literals                               |
| `.m`   | `LiteralNumber`      | Numeric constants                             |
| `.c`   | `Comment`            | Single and multi-line comments                |
| `.kd`  | `KeywordDeclaration` | Type declarations                             |
| `.kt`  | `KeywordType`        | Primitive types (`int`, `string`, `bool`)     |
| `.err` | `Error`              | Syntax errors                                 |

This keeps network payloads minimal and guarantees that CSS stylesheets define colors cleanly through CSS custom properties (`--k`, `--nf`, `--s`, `--c`).

## 5. Byte-Budgeted LRU Memory Cache

Generated HTML fragments are cached in memory using a Least Recently Used (LRU) eviction policy backed by Go's `container/list`.

```go
const cacheBudget = 512 * 1024 * 1024 // 512 MB memory budget
```

- Every cached line entry tracks its raw string byte footprint.
- When total cached line data exceeds `cacheBudget`, oldest entries are evicted from the tail of the LRU list until memory drops below the threshold.
- Switching between tabs and scrolling backward reuses cached HTML strings instantly without hitting Chroma.
